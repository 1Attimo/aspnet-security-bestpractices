# ASP.NET MVC Security Best Practices

This document provides information on some of the best practices developers should follow to avoid certain  security breaches. Each section of this document describes a possible use-case scenario that exposes the security issue and the vulnerabilities associated with it, together with information on how to mitigate the security problems.

The security issues are all shown using a simple Visual Studio solution. Fully commented code samples are  provided as part of that solution to show how to avoid each security breach. You will need to have DevExpress ASP.NET MVC extensions installed in order to load and compile the solution. You can download the installer from the [DevExpress website](https://devexpress.com).

## 1. Uploading Files

**Related extensions**: [Binary Image](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/9010/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/Data-Editors-Extensions/BinaryImage/Overview/Overview-BinaryImage), [Upload Control](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/9002/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/File-Management/File-Upload/Overview/Overview-UploadControl), [File Manager](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/15115/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/File-Management/File-Manager/Overview/Overview-FileManager), [Html Editor](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/8999/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/HTML-Editor/Overview/Overview-HtmlEditor), [Rich Edit](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/114046/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/Rich-Text-Editor/Overview/Overview-Rich-Text-Editor), [Spreadsheet](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/17114/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/Spreadsheet/Overview/Overview-Spreadsheet)

**Security Risks**: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html), [CWE-434](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)

This section provides information on how to provide file upload capabilities within your web application. There are several separate scenarios to cover:

* [1.1. Stop Malicious Files Being Uploaded](#11-prevent-uploading-malicious-files)
* [1.2. Avoid Uncontrolled Resource Consumption](#12-prevent-uncontrolled-resource-consumption)
* [1.3. Protect Temporary Files](#13-protect-temporary-files)

### 1.1. Stop Malicious Files Being Uploaded
See the [controller code](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/72492709fd0c53fef25414fc77df9a37fc4dc5a7/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Controllers/UploadingFiles/UploadingFiles.cs#L12-L57) in the **Controllers\UploadingFiles\UploadingFiles.cs** file of the example project for a full code sample.

Consider the situation where your web application allows for files to be uploaded. These files are then accessed using a specific URL (for example: *example.com/uploaded/uploaded-filename*). 

The possible security breach here occurs when a malicious file is uploaded that can then be executed on the server side. For example, a malefactor could upload a file containing malicious code and guess at its URL. If the malefactor is correct and requests this URL, the file would be executed on the server as if it were part of the application.

To mitigate this vulnerability, do the following:

1. Implement a custom model binder. In the model binder implementation, initialize the [AllowedFileExtensions](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebUploadControlValidationSettings_AllowedFileExtensionstopic) setting with a list of allowed file extensions. The server will then validate the type of the uploaded file. Provide the [FilesUploadCompleteHandler](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebMvcBinderSettingsUploadControlBinderSettings_FileUploadCompleteHandlertopic) to perform any additional checks: 
``` cs
public class UploadValidationBinder : DevExpressEditorsBinder {
    public UploadValidationBinder() {
        // Specify allowed fie extensions
        UploadControlBinderSettings.ValidationSettings.AllowedFileExtensions = new[] { ".jpg", ".png" };
        UploadControlBinderSettings.FilesUploadCompleteHandler = uploadControl_FilesUploadComplete;
    }
    private void uploadControl_FilesUploadComplete(object sender, FilesUploadCompleteEventArgs e) {
        var uploadedFiles = ((MVCxUploadControl)sender).UploadedFiles;
        if(uploadedFiles != null && uploadedFiles.Length > 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < uploadedFiles.Length; i++) {
                UploadedFile file = uploadedFiles[i];
                if(file.IsValid && file.FileName != "") {
                    using(var stream = file.FileContent) {
                        // In case additional checks are needed perform them here before saving the file
                        if(!IsValidImage(stream)) {
                            file.IsValid = false;
                            e.ErrorText = "Validation failed!";
                        } else {
                            string fileName = string.Format("{0}{1}", HostingEnvironment.MapPath("~/Upload/Images/"), file.FileName);
                            file.SaveAs(fileName, true);
                        }
                    }
                }            
            }
        }
    }              
}
```

Note that it is not enough to specify the allowed file extension on the View side:
``` cs
@using(Html.BeginForm()) {
    @Html.DevExpress().UploadControl(
        settings => {
            settings.Name = "uploadControl";
            ...
            settings.ValidationSettings.AllowedFileExtensions = new[] { ".jpg", ".png" };
    }).GetHtml()
}
```
This option only affects the client behavior. It prevents input errors but does not strictly prohibit sending a malicious file to the server.





2. Aditionally, you can disable file execution in the upload folder ([relevant StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3776847/how-to-restrict-folder-access-in-asp-net)):
``` aspx
  <location path="UploadingFiles/Images">
    <system.webServer>
      <handlers>
        <clear />
        <add
          name="StaticFile"
          path="*" verb="*"
          modules="StaticFileModule"
          resourceType="Either"
          requireAccess="Read" />
      </handlers>
    </system.webServer>
  </location>
```
The default file extensions allowed by various controls that allow for file uploads: 

| Control                 | Allowed Extensions                                                  
| ----------------------- | ------------------                                                  
| **Upload Control**      | *any*                                                               
| **Binary Image**        | *any*                                                               
| **File Manager**        | *any*                                                               
| **Html Editor**         | .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .gif, .png <br> .mp3, .ogg <br> .swf <br> .mp4   
| **Rich Edit**           | .doc, .docx, .epub, .html, .htm, .mht, .mhtml, .odt, .txt, .rtf, .xml
| **Spreadsheet**         | .xlsx, .xlsm, .xls, .xltx, .xltm, .xlt, .txt, .csv        



### 1.2. Prevent Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
See the [controller code](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/72492709fd0c53fef25414fc77df9a37fc4dc5a7/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Controllers/UploadingFiles/UploadingFiles.cs#L59-L99) in the **Controllers\UploadingFiles\UploadingFiles.cs** file for a full code sample.

Consider the situation where the web application allows files of any size to be uploaded. 

The possible security breach here occurs when a malefactor performs a denial of service ([DoS](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)) attack by uploading very large files, thereby using up server memory and disk space.

To mitigate this vulnerability:


1. Access file contents using the [FileContent](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebUploadedFile_FileContenttopic) property (a Stream) rather than the [FileBytes](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebUploadedFile_FileBytestopic) property (a byte array). This will avoid memory overflow and other issues when processing large uploaded files.
``` cs
public class UploadInMemoryProcessingBinder : DevExpressEditorsBinder {
    public UploadInMemoryProcessingBinder() {
        UploadControlBinderSettings.FilesUploadCompleteHandler = uploadControl_FilesUploadInMemoryProcessingComplete;
    }

    private void uploadControl_FilesUploadInMemoryProcessingComplete(object sender, FilesUploadCompleteEventArgs e) {
        var uploadedFiles = ((MVCxUploadControl)sender).UploadedFiles;
        if(uploadedFiles != null && uploadedFiles.Length > 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < uploadedFiles.Length; i++) {
                UploadedFile file = uploadedFiles[i];
                if(file.IsValid && file.FileName != "") {
                    // Good approach - use stream for large files
                    using(var stream = file.FileContent) {
                        DoProcessing(stream);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```
2. Specify the maximum size for uploaded files using the [UploadControlValidationSettings.MaxFileSize](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebUploadControlValidationSettings_MaxFileSizetopic) property.  

``` cs
public class UploadValidationBinder : DevExpressEditorsBinder {
    public UploadValidationBinder() {
        UploadControlBinderSettings.ValidationSettings.MaxFileSize = "1000000"
    }
}

```

Note that in the **Advanced** uploading mode, files are loaded in small fragments (200KB by default), thus setting the **httpRuntime**>**maxRequestLength** and **requestLimits**>**maxAllowedContentLength** options in **web.config** is not sufficient to prevent attacks.

See the [Uploading Large Files](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/9822/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/File-Management/File-Upload/Concepts/Uploading-Large-Files) documentation topic for more information.

The following extensions limit the maximum size for uploaded files by default:
* The **Html Editor** defines a 31,457,280 byte limit for uploaded file size.
* The **Spreadsheet** and **Rich Edit** do not set a maximum size for an uploaded file, however there is a 31,457,280 byte limit for images to be inserted into a document. Note that both controls must be specifically enabled to allow for the uploading of files.

The File Manager automatically allows files to be uploaded, and does not impose any limitations on the file size and extension. You can disable file uploading with this View code:
``` cs
@Html.DevExpress().FileManager(settings =>
{
    settings.Name = "FileManager";
    settings.SettingsUpload.Enabled = false;
    ...
}).BindToFolder(Model).GetHtml()
```  
Other operations on files organized by the File Manager (copy, delete, download, etc.) are configured using the [SettingsEditing](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/DevExpressWebMvcFileManagerSettings_SettingsEditingtopic) property. All such operations are disabled by default.


### 1.3. Protect Temporary Files
See the [controller code](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/72492709fd0c53fef25414fc77df9a37fc4dc5a7/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Controllers/UploadingFiles/UploadingFiles.cs#L101-L130) in the **Controllers\UploadingFiles\UploadingFiles.cs** file for a full code sample. 

Consider the situation where you store temporary files on the server, prior to processing them on the server (for example, to extract the data within to write to a database).

To avoid a security breach, you will need to ensure that these files are inaccessible to third parties.  

To mitigate this vulnerability:

1. Store temporary files in a folder unreachable by URL (for example, *App_Data*).
2. Use a dedicated file extension for temporary files on the server (for example *".mytmp"). 
3. Consider assigning random file names using the [GetRandomFileName](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.path.getrandomfilename(v=vs.110).aspx) method.
``` cs
public class UploadSavingTemporaryFilesBinder : DevExpressEditorsBinder {
    public UploadSavingTemporaryFilesBinder() {
        UploadControlBinderSettings.FilesUploadCompleteHandler = uploadControl_FilesUploadSavingTemporaryFilesComplete;
    }

    private void uploadControl_FilesUploadSavingTemporaryFilesComplete(object sender, FilesUploadCompleteEventArgs e) {
        var uploadedFiles = ((MVCxUploadControl)sender).UploadedFiles;
        if(uploadedFiles != null && uploadedFiles.Length > 0) {
            for(int i = 0; i < uploadedFiles.Length; i++) {
                UploadedFile file = uploadedFiles[i];
                if(file.IsValid && file.FileName != "") {
                    // Assign a random file name
                    string fileName = string.Format("{0}{1}", HostingEnvironment.MapPath("~/Upload/Processing/"),
                        Path.GetRandomFileName() + ".tmp");
                    file.SaveAs(fileName, true);
                    // DoFileProcessing(fileName);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```

You can also define security permissions for folders and files accessible through the File Manager control. The  [Access Rules](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/119542/ASP-NET-WebForms-Controls/File-Management/File-Manager/Concepts/Access-Control-Overview/Access-Rules) documentation topic has further information.

## 2. Uploading and Displaying Binary Images
**Related Extension**: [Binary Image](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/9010/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/Data-Editors-Extensions/BinaryImage/Overview/Overview-BinaryImage), [Upload Control](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/9002/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/File-Management/File-Upload/Overview/Overview-UploadControl)

**Security Risks**: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)


Consider the situation where an image is uploaded to the server. The server generates a page that contains the image, and a user opens that page in their browser.

The possible security breach is this: a malefactor creates a file containing a malicious script. This file is an image file extension, is added to the generated page by the server, and that page is downloaded by the user's browser. This results in the malicious script being run in the browser. Essentially this is an example of XSS (Cross-site Scripting) via content-sniffing, a particular case of [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).

To familiarize yourself with the issue:

1. Comment out the call of the **IsValidImage** method in the example project's [Controllers/UploadingBinaryImages/UploadControl.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Controllers/UploadingBinaryImages/UploadingBinaryImages.cs) to disable protection:
   ``` cs
    // Here contentBytes should be saved to a database
    using(var stream = e.UploadedFile.FileContent) {
    //     if(!IsValidImage(stream)) {
    //        e.ErrorText = "Invalid image.";
    //        e.IsValid = false;
    //    } else {
            string fileName = HostingEnvironment.MapPath("~/App_Data/UploadedData/avatar.jpg");
            e.UploadedFile.SaveAs(fileName, true);
    //    }
    }
   ```
2. Run the example solution and open the **[UploadingBinaryImages/UploadControl](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/77534a317c3d685810e57cf034994d99a2d1c58f/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Controllers/UploadingBinaryImages/UploadingBinaryImages.cs#L14)** page.
3. Upload the **[\App_Data\TestData\Content-Sniffing-XSS.jpg](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/App_Data/TestData/Content-Sniffing-XSS.jpg)** file. This is nominally a JPEG image, but in fact is a JavaScript file that emulates a malicious script.
4. Open the **[UploadingBinaryImage/BinaryImageViewer](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/77534a317c3d685810e57cf034994d99a2d1c58f/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Controllers/UploadingBinaryImages/UploadingBinaryImages.cs#L79-L90)** page. As with every ASPX request, the markup is generated by the server on request, and the uploaded file will be added to the code behind.
5. The JavaScript code from the uploaded file is executed by the browser:

![malicious-image](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/uploading-binary-image-mvc.png?raw=true)

To mitigate this vulnerability:

1.	Programmatically check whether the uploaded file is really an image before saving it to any server-side storage (see the [IsValidImage](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/77534a317c3d685810e57cf034994d99a2d1c58f/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Controllers/UploadingBinaryImages/UploadingBinaryImages.cs#L42-L50) method implementation).
``` cs
public class UploadControlBinder : DevExpressEditorsBinder {
    public UploadControlBinder() {
        UploadControlBinderSettings.ValidationSettings.AllowedFileExtensions = new[] { ".jpg", ".jpeg" };
        UploadControlBinderSettings.FileUploadCompleteHandler = uploadControl_FileUploadComplete;
    }

    private void uploadControl_FileUploadComplete(object sender, FileUploadCompleteEventArgs e) {
        if(!e.UploadedFile.IsValid) return;

        // Here contentBytes should be saved to a database
        using(var stream = e.UploadedFile.FileContent) {
            if(!IsValidImage(stream)) {
                e.ErrorText = "Invalid image.";
                e.IsValid = false;
            } else {
                // We save it to a file for demonstration purposes
                string fileName = HostingEnvironment.MapPath("~/App_Data/UploadedData/avatar.jpg");
                e.UploadedFile.SaveAs(fileName, true);
            }
        }
    }
}

static bool IsValidImage(Stream stream) {
    try {
        using(var image = Image.FromStream(stream)) {
            return true;
        }
    } catch(Exception) {
        return false;
    }
}
```

2.	Use the [Binary Image](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument9010) extension for uploading images. This control automatically implements an image file type check.

\[View\]
``` cs
@Html.DevExpress().BinaryImage(biSettings => {
    biSettings.Name = "BinaryImage";
    biSettings.Properties.EditingSettings.Enabled = true;
    biSettings.Properties.EditingSettings.UploadSettings.UploadValidationSettings.MaxFileSize = 4194304;
    biSettings.CallbackRouteValues = new { Controller = "UploadingBinaryImages", Action = "UpdateBinaryImagePartial" };
    biSettings.Properties.ClientSideEvents.ValueChanged = "function () { SubmitButton.SetEnabled(true); }";
}).Bind(Model).GetHtml()
```
\[Controller\]
``` cs
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult SaveBinaryImage() {
    byte[] contentBytes = BinaryImageEditExtension.GetValue<byte[]>("BinaryImage"); // Uploaded file content are valided by Binary Image

    // Here contentBytes should be saved to a database
    // We will save it to a file for demonstration purposes
    string fileName = HostingEnvironment.MapPath("~/App_Data/UploadedData/avatar.jpg");
    System.IO.File.WriteAllBytes(fileName, contentBytes != null ? contentBytes : new byte[0] { });

    return RedirectToAction("BinaryImage");
}

```

Another strong recommendation is to *always* specify the exact content type when you add binary data to the response:

**Correct:** `Response.ContentType = "image/jpeg"`;

**Potential security breach:** `Response.ContentType = "image"`.

Additionally, it is a good practice to add the ```X-CONTENT-TYPE-OPTIONS="nosniff"``` response header:

``` cs
Response.Headers.Add("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");
```




### Notes:
1. Microsoft Edge automatically detects a file's type based on its content, which prevents the execution of malicious scripts as described here.
2. Make sure to specify the maximum uploaded file size to prevent those DoS attacks based on uploading large files.

## 3. Authorization 
**Related Extension**:  [Document Viewer](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument114491), [Web Dashboard](https://documentation.devexpress.com/Dashboard/16977/Building-the-Designer-and-Viewer-Applications/Web-Dashboard/ASP-NET-MVC-Dashboard-Extension), [Query Builder](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument120076)

**Security Risks**: [CWE-285](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/285.html)

This section provides information on using DevExpress controls in web applications that implement authorization and access control. The following features are considered:

* [3.1. Using Authorization Attributes](#31-using-authorization-attributes )
* [3.2. Reporting](#32-reporting)
* [3.3. Dashboard](#33-dashboard)
* [3.4. Query Builder](#34-query-builder)

### 3.1 Using Authorization Attributes 
In ASP.NET MVC, authorization rules for a web application's pages are defined on the controller side using the **[Authorize]** attribute. This attribute can be applied either to a controller action or to the whole controller class. 

For maximum security, it is recommended that you apply the **[Authorize]** attribute to the controller and allow anonymous access to actions that should be public using the **[AllowAnonymous]** attribute.

``` cs
namespace SecurityBestPractices.Mvc.Controllers {
    [Authorize]
    public partial class AuthorizationController : Controller {
        // GET: /Authorization/Reports/PublicReport
        [AllowAnonymous]
        public ActionResult PublicReport() {
            return View("Reports/PublicReport");
        }

        // GET: /Authorization/Reports/ReportViewer
        public ActionResult ReportViewer() {
            return View("Reports/ReportViewer", 
                new ReportNameModel() { ReportName = 
                ReportStorageWithAccessRules.GetViewableReportDisplayNamesForCurrentUser().FirstOrDefault()});
        }
...
```


### 3.2. Reporting
Note that, by restricting access to certain pages that contain the [Document Viewer](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument114491) extension, that access restriction is not automatically passed on to the report files that these pages might display. These files can still be accessed by the Document Viewer control from other pages through the client-side API. If a malefactor knows (or guesses) a report name, they can open it by calling the client-side [OpenReport](http://help.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/DevExpressXtraReportsWebScriptsASPxClientWebDocumentViewer_OpenReporttopic) method:

``` js
documentViewer.OpenReport("ReportTypeName"); 
```

It is not possible to utilize standard authorization mechanisms because the Document Viewer's AJAX requests are handled not by a controller action, but by a special HTTP handler (**DXXRDV.axd**).  

To mitigate this particular vulnerability, you should implement a custom report storage derived from the [ReportStorageWebExtension](http://help.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsWebExtensionsReportStorageWebExtensiontopic) class. This storage will be used by the HTTP handler to access your reports and here you can define your authorization rules. As a starting point, you can copy the reference implementation of such a storage class from the example project's [ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.WebForms/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs) file to your application and fine-tune it for your needs. The following customizations would have to be considered:


#### A. Viewing Reports

In the sample project, the [GetViewableReportDisplayNamesForCurrentUser](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs#L25-L38) method returns a list of reports that can be viewed by the currently logged-in user:

``` cs
// Logic for getting reports available for viewing
public static IEnumerable<string> GetViewableReportDisplayNamesForCurrentUser() {
    var identityName = GetIdentityName();

    var result = new List<string> { reports[typeof(PublicReport)] }; // For unauthenticated users (i.e., public)

    if (identityName == "Admin") {
        result.AddRange(new[] { reports[typeof(AdminReport)], reports[typeof(JohnReport)] });
    } else if (identityName == "John") {
        result.Add(reports[typeof(JohnReport)]);
    }
    return result;
}
```

This method is then called from the overridden [GetData](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs#L60-L70) method and other methods that need to interact with the report storage:

``` cs
public override byte[] GetData(string url) {
    var reportNames = GetViewableReportDisplayNamesForCurrentUser();
    if (!reportNames.Contains(url))
        throw new UnauthorizedAccessException();

    XtraReport publicReport = CreateReportByDisplayName(url);
    using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream()) {
        publicReport.SaveLayoutToXml(ms);
        return ms.GetBuffer();
    }
}
```


#### B. Editing Reports
In the sample project, the [GetEditableReportNamesForCurrentUser](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs#L41-L53) method returns a list of reports that can be edited by the currently logged-in user:

``` cs
// Logic for getting reports available for editing
public static IEnumerable<string> GetEditableReportNamesForCurrentUser() {
    var identityName = GetIdentityName();
    if (identityName == "Admin") {
        return new[] { reports[typeof(AdminReport)], reports[typeof(JohnReport)] };
    }
    if (identityName == "John") {
        return new[] { reports[typeof(JohnReport)] };
    }

    return Array.Empty<string>();
}
```

This method is then called from the overridden [IsValidUrl](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportStorageWithAccessRules.cs#L80-L83) method and other methods that need to write report data.

``` cs
public override bool IsValidUrl(string url) {
    var reportNames = GetEditableReportNamesForCurrentUser();
    return reportNames.Contains(url);
}
```

To prevent errors in the browser when handling unauthorized access attempts, check the access rights on the page's [PageLoad](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/408c2328fc8d567281994b2bba52d0705850c0b5/SecurityBestPractices/Authorization/Reports/ReportDesignerPage.aspx.cs#L6-L13) event. If the user is not authorized to open the report, redirect them to a public page.

``` cs
// GET: /Authorization/Reports/ReportDesigner/<Report Url>
public ActionResult ReportDesigner(string name) {
    var reportNames = ReportStorageWithAccessRules.GetEditableReportNamesForCurrentUser();
    if(reportNames.Contains(name))
        return View("Reports/ReportDesigner", new ReportNameModel() { ReportName = name });
    else
        return RedirectToAction("ReportViewer", "Authorization");
}
``` 


#### Register the Custom Report Storage
After implementing your custom report storage with the required access rules, you must register it in the [Global.asax.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Global.asax.cs) file: 

``` cs
DevExpress.XtraReports.Web.Extensions.ReportStorageWebExtension.RegisterExtensionGlobal(new ReportStorageWithAccessRules());
```     

#### Make Sure that Authentication Rules are Applied
In the example project, you can check whether the customization has had any effect by using the following steps:
* Open the [PublicReportPage](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/77534a317c3d685810e57cf034994d99a2d1c58f/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Controllers/Authorization/AuthorizationController.Reports.cs#L11-L13) page without logging in. This page contains a Report Viewer.
* Try to open a report using the client API in the browser console. The example report has restricted access:
```
>documentViewer.OpenReport("Admin Report");
```
The browser console will respond with the following error.

![console-output](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/authoriazation-reports-accessdenied.png?raw=true)

#### Provide an Operation Logger
By default, the Web Document Viewer control access a report by a GUID, which serves as an authorization token. If required, you can provide additional protection by implementing a custom Operation Logger in order to enforce fine-grained control over which operations are available to a user. Extend the [WebDocumentViewerOperationLogger](http://help.devexpress.com/#XtraReports/clsDevExpressXtraReportsWebWebDocumentViewerWebDocumentViewerOperationLoggertopic) class and override this class's methods to implement the required access control rules (see the [OperationLogger.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Services/Reports/OperationLogger.cs) file of the example project). 

Register the operation logger in [Global.asax.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Services/Reports/OperationLogger.cs):

``` cs
DefaultWebDocumentViewerContainer.Register<WebDocumentViewerOperationLogger, OperationLogger>();
```

Note that in order to simplify the example project the logger implementation obtains the required user account data from a static property. This is not a recommended solution: such an implementation could have difficulties running in a cloud environment or on a web farm. Instead, we recommend that you store authentication information in some appropriate data storage. 

To familiarize yourself with the solution:

1. Run the example application, log in using the [Login](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/77534a317c3d685810e57cf034994d99a2d1c58f/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Controllers/AccountController.cs#L21-L24) page. 
2. Open the report preview ([Authorization/Reports/ReportViewer](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/77534a317c3d685810e57cf034994d99a2d1c58f/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Controllers/Authorization/AuthorizationController.Reports.cs#L16-L20)) in a separate browser tab. 
3. Log out.
4. Try switching report pages.

The following error will be signalled:

![Operation Logger Error](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/authorization-reportopertaionlogger.png?raw=true)


#### Restrict Access to Data Connections and Data Tables
The [Report Designer](https://documentation.devexpress.com/XtraReports/17103/Creating-End-User-Reporting-Applications/Web-Reporting/Report-Designer)  allows a user to browse available data connection and data tables using the integrated [Query Builder](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument120076). Refer to the [Query Builder](#33-query-builder) subsection in this document to learn how to restrict access to this information, based on authorization rules. 





### 3.3. Dashboard

The [DevExpress Web Dashboard](https://documentation.devexpress.com/Dashboard/16977/Building-the-Designer-and-Viewer-Applications/Web-Dashboard/ASP-NET-MVC-Dashboard-Extension) requires a controller, that inherits the **DashboardController** class. This class provides predefined actions that handle all AJAX requests from the dashboard.

The access control should be performed by a custom dashboard storage class that implements the [IEditableDashboardStorage](https://docs.devexpress.com/Dashboard/DevExpress.DashboardWeb.IEditableDashboardStorage?tabs=tabid-csharp%2Ctabid-T392813_7_52373613) interface.

As a starting point, you can copy the reference implementation of such a storage class from the example project's [DashboardStorageWithAccessRules.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Services/Dashboards/DashboardStorageWithAccessRules.cs) file to your application and fine-tune it for your needs.

The [DashboardStorageWithAccessRules](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/77534a317c3d685810e57cf034994d99a2d1c58f/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Services/Dashboards/DashboardStorageWithAccessRules.cs#L10-L117) class implementation defines the access restrictions:

``` cs
// Register dashboard layouts
var adminId = AddDashboardCore(XDocument.Load(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(@"/App_Data/AdminDashboard.xml")), "Admin Dashboard");
var johnId = AddDashboardCore(XDocument.Load(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(@"/App_Data/JohnDashboard.xml")), "John Dashboard");
this.publicDashboardId = AddDashboardCore(XDocument.Load(HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(publicDashboardPath)), "Public Dashboard");
```

The following code defines which user should have access to which dashboards:

``` cs
// Authorization logic
authDictionary.Add("Admin", new HashSet<string>(new [] { adminId, johnId, publicDashboardId })); // Admin can view/edit all dashboards.
authDictionary.Add("John", new HashSet<string>(new[] { johnId })); // John can view/edit only his dashboard.

public bool IsAuthorized(string dashboardId) {
    var identityName = GetIdentityName();
    if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(identityName)) {
        return authDictionary.ContainsKey(identityName) && authDictionary[identityName].Contains(dashboardId);
    }

    return false;
}

static string GetIdentityName() {
    return HttpContext.Current.User?.Identity?.Name;
}
```

Register the custom dashboard storage class in the [Global.asax.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Global.asax.cs) file as shown below.

``` cs
DashboardConfigurator.Default.SetDashboardStorage(new DashboardStorageWithAccessRules());
```

With this custom implementation of a dashboard storage, if a user named 'John' tries to use the client API to open a report with restricted access (e.g., a report with id='1'), the handler will return error 404, File Not Found:

``` js
dashboard.LoadDashboard('1') // Load a dashboard available only to Admin.
```


```
GET http://localhost:2088/dashboardDesigner/dashboards/1?_=1536758969547 404 (Not Found)
```

#### Restrict Access to Data Connections and Data Tables
The Web Dashboard control allows a user to browse available data connection and data tables using the integrated [Query Builder](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument120076). Refer to the [Query Builder](#33-query-builder) subsection in this document to learn how to restrict access to this information based on authorization rules.



### 3.4. Query Builder

The standalone [Query Builder](http://help.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument120076) as well as the Query Builder integrated into the Report and Dashboard designers allows an end-user to browse a web application's data connections and the data tables available through those connections. In a web application that uses access control, you will to write code to restrict a user's access to the available connections and data tables.

To restrict access to connection strings, implement a custom connection string provider:

``` cs
public class DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider : IDataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider {

    public Dictionary<string, string> GetConnectionDescriptions() {
        Dictionary<string, string> connections =
            new Dictionary<string, string> { { "nwindConnection", "NWind database" } };

        // Customize the loaded connections list.  

        // Access restriction logic.
        //if(GetIdentityName() == "Admin")
        //    connections.Add("secretConnection", "Admin only database");

        return connections;
    }

    public DataConnectionParametersBase GetDataConnectionParameters(string name) {
        return AppConfigHelper.LoadConnectionParameters(name);
    }
}
```

To restrict access to data tables, implement a custom database schema provider:

``` cs
public class DBSchemaProviderEx : IDBSchemaProviderEx {
    public DBTable[] GetTables(SqlDataConnection connection, params string[] tableList) {
        // Check permissions.

        var dbTables = connection.GetDBSchema().Tables;
        return dbTables.Where(t => t.Name == "Categories" || t.Name == "Products").ToArray();
    }

    public DBTable[] GetViews(SqlDataConnection connection, params string[] viewList) {
        return Array.Empty<DBTable>();
    }

    public DBStoredProcedure[] GetProcedures(SqlDataConnection connection, params string[] procedureList) {
        return Array.Empty<DBStoredProcedure>();
    }

    public void LoadColumns(SqlDataConnection connection, params DBTable[] tables) {
    }
}
```


The Dashboard Designer requires the database schema provider to be created by a factory object:

``` cs
public class DataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory : DevExpress.DataAccess.Web.IDataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory {
    public IDBSchemaProviderEx Create() {
        return new DBSchemaProviderEx();
    }
}
```
As a starting point, you can copy the reference implementation from the example project's [DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Services/DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider.cs) and [DataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Services/DataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory.cs) files to your application and fine-tune it for your needs.

Register the implemented classes for the Report Designer, Dashboard Designer, or standalone Query Builder in the [Global.asax.cs](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/master/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/SecurityBestPractices.Mvc/Global.asax.cs) file, as shown here:

**Report Designer:**
``` cs
DefaultReportDesignerContainer.RegisterDataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider<DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider>();
DefaultReportDesignerContainer.RegisterDataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory<DataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory>();
```

**Dashboard Designer:**
``` cs
DefaultQueryBuilderContainer.Register<IDataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider, DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider>();
DefaultQueryBuilderContainer.RegisterDataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory<DataSourceWizardDBSchemaProviderExFactory>();
```

**Query Builder:**
``` cs
DashboardConfigurator.Default.SetConnectionStringsProvider(new DataSourceWizardConnectionStringsProvider());
DashboardConfigurator.Default.SetDBSchemaProvider(new DBSchemaProviderEx());
```

## 4. Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
**Related Extension**: Extensions with data editing available by default (e.g., [Grid View](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/8998/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/Grid-View/Overview/Overview-GridView), [Card View](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/114559/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/Card-View/Overview/Overview-CardView), [Vertical Grid](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/116060/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/Vertical-Grid/Overview/Overview-VerticalGrid), [Tree List](https://documentation.devexpress.com/AspNet/13766/ASP-NET-MVC-Extensions/Tree-List/Overview/Overview-TreeList), etc.)

**Security Risks**: [CWE-352](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

This section provides information on how to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks on your web application. The vulnerability affects applications performing data editing requests including those using DevExpress AJAX-enabled controls such as the Grid View. Although there are authorization mechanisms that allow you to deny access by Insecure Direct Object References (for example: *example.com/app/SecureReport.aspx?id=1*), they do not protect you from CSRF attacks.

The possible security breach could occur as follows: 

1.	A malefactor implements a phishing page. 
2.	A user inadvertently visits this phishing page, which then sends a malicious request to your web application using the user's cookies.
3.	As a result, the malicious action is performed on the user's behalf, allowing the malefactor to access or modify the user's data or account info.

For more information on the vulnerability, refer to the [CWE-352 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html) article.


To mitigate the vulnerability, use the **AntiForgeryToken** pattern as described below:

1. Generate an anti-forgery token for a form in the view code as shown below:
   ``` cs
   @using(Html.BeginForm()) {
       @Html.AntiForgeryToken()
       ...
   }
   ```
   This generates the following hidden field:
   ``` html
   <input name="__RequestVerificationToken" type="hidden" value="[Token Value]">
   ``` 
2. Be aware that complex AJAX-enabled controls do not automatically include the token field's value in their AJAX requests. You need to manually add the token value to such requests. You can achieve this using the code below:
   ``` cs
   <script>
        // sending the __RequestVerificationToken value manually
        $.ajaxPrefilter(function (options, originalOptions, xhr) {
        var tokenValue = $('input:hidden[name="__RequestVerificationToken"]').val();
        if (tokenValue && options && options.data && options.data.indexOf('RequestVerificationToken') === -1)
            options.data += "&__RequestVerificationToken=" + tokenValue;
        });
   </script>
   ```
3. To automatically check the request token on the server side, apply the **ValidateAntiForgeryToken** attribute to the corresponding controller action:
   ``` cs
   [ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
   public ActionResult EditFormDeletePartial(int id = -1) {
       if(id >= 0)
           EditFormItems.Delete(id);
       return EditFormPartial();
   }
   ```

If the validation fails, the server will generate an error:

![AntiForgeryError](https://github.com/DevExpress/aspnet-security-bestpractices/blob/wiki-static-resources/anti-forgery-error.png?raw=true)


Note that you should never perform data modifying requests using the **Get** verb.
