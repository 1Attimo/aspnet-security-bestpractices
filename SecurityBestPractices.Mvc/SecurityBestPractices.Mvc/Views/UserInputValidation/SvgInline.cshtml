<p>Inline SVG images are potentionaly unsecure, display such images only from trusted sources!</p>
<p>In this example, SVG bytes uploaded by an end user are stored in the data source and embedded inline. As the result, JavaScript is excecuted in the client browser:</p>

@{
    // Obtain image data from the data source
    var svgImageWithJavaScriptCode = "<svg height=100 width=100><circle cx=50 cy=50 r=40 stroke=black stroke-width=2 fill=red /><script>alert('XXS')</script></svg>";

    <div style="width:100px;">
        @Html.Raw(svgImageWithJavaScriptCode)
    </div>

}
